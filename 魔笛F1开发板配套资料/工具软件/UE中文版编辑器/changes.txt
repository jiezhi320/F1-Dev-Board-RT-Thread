        - Added INI settings allowing user to determine if the BOM should be
          written:
          - Write UTF-8 BOM = 1 - This setting causes the editor to write out
            the Byte Order Mark (BOM) header in a file when it is saved.  If
            this is not set, it will not write out the BOM unless the file
            contained it when it was loaded into the editor.  If so, the BOM
            will be written to the file irrespective of the setting.  The BOM
            is an industry standard indicating the contents of the file for
            various UNICODE formats.  This is set be default internally.
          - Write UTF-8 BOM NF = 1 - This setting causes the editor to write out
            the Byte Order Mark (BOM) header in a file when it is saved if the
            file is a new file created within UltraEdit.  If the Write UTF-8 BOM
            setting above is set, then the BOM will always be written and this is
            ignored.  Otherwise, the BOM will only be written out for new files
            if this is set.
