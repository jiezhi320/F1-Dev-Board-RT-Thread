Changes in SecureCRT 7.0.4 (Official) -- April 4, 2013
------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT could crash if an SFTP tab was performing a transfer and 
    the tabbed session that launched the SFTP tab was closed.
  - If several tabbed sessions were connected and CTRL+TAB was used
    to cycle through them, the tab contents were not always updated.
  - If a session could not be cloned because the channel connection
    failed, the cloned session's tab title was blank.
  - SSH2: If a session specified a remote SFTP directory that contained
    an invalid character, such as "~", SecureCRT crashed when attemping
    to connect the SFTP tab.
  - Windows: On Windows XP, if a session specified more than 140 local
    forwards, when the session connected, the forwards above the 140th
    failed.
  - Mac: If a session had the "Scale the font" resize option set and
    SecureCRT was maximized, the last line was not visible.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.0.3 (Official) -- January 17, 2013
---------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - In the Connect dialog, if a folder was renamed to a string that
    ended in one or more "." characters, the sessions in the folder
    were deleted.
  - Opening the default session in a script caused SecureCRT to crash.
  - If the "Automate logon" items for a session were re-ordered, the
    changes were not saved.
  - If "/Serial" or "/Tapi" (Windows only) was specified on the
    command line, it was not honored.
  - If a session that contained ANSI color text in the scrollback was
    disconnected and reconnected, the ANSI color attributes were no
    longer in the scrollback.
  - When enough tabs were open to require the scroll control on the
    tab bar, if the right-most tab was activated and renamed, the tab
    bar shifted to the left and the active tab was no longer visible.
  - Serial: The stop bits were not logged correctly in the trace
    output.
  - SSH1/SSH2: If a session used a dynamic tunnel on port 10080 and
    another SSH1/SSH2 session went through the first session's SOCKS
    proxy and used a dynamic tunnel on port 1080, SecureCRT crashed
    when data went through the second tunnel.
  - Windows: When switching between tiled and tabbed sessions in a
    maximized window, the terminal area was 24x80 instead of the full
    window area.
  - Windows: If the global option "Minimize to Activator in system tray"
    was set and SecureCRT was closed, if "Connect" was selected from
    the Activator menu, the icons in the Connect dialog were not mapped
    to the correct actions.
  - Mac: The session option "Use ALT as meta key" was not
    always honored.
  - Mac: If the global option "Host key database location" was changed
    to a different path, the new path was not saved.

    was selected, focus did not return to the SecureCRT window.

    different session's tab had focus, the title bar was updated to
    display the reconnected session name.
  - Windows: If a laptop was docked such that a secondary monitor was
    used and then SecureCRT was moved to that monitor and closed, when
    the laptop was disconnected from the dock and SecureCRT was
    restarted, it was visible in the task bar, but not on the laptop
    display.
  - Windows: On a system that had two monitors with the primary
    monitor having a larger display resolution than the secondary
    monitor, when SecureCRT was maximized on the primary monitor and
    then restored, it used the resolution of the secondary monitor.
  - Windows: When the sessions were tiled, if the main window was
    resized, some of the tiled windows did not send a screen resize to
    the remote system.

    global option "Use Keychain" was set.
  - Mac: If the global option "Show confirm disconnect dialog" was set
    and multiple SecureCRT windows with connected sessions were open

    remaining windows using COMMAND+` did not work.
