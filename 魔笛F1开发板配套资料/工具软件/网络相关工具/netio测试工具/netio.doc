NETIO - Network Benchmark, Version 1.32
(C) 1997-2012 Kai Uwe Rommel

This is a network benchmark for OS/2 2.x, Windows, Linux and Unix.
It measures the net throughput of a network via TCP and UDP
protocols using various different packet sizes.

One instance has to run on one machine as a server process, another 
instance is used on another machine to perform the benchmark. When 
executed without arguments, the program will explain its usage.

Full source code is included. For compilation, IBM C/C++ for OS/2 
or gcc (mingw) for Windows is required, gcc can be used under Unix.

Starting with version 1.20, multi threading support is required.
Under Unix this has to be pthreads (tested with Linux). Therefore,
DOS is no longer supported beginning with version 1.20.

A few executable files are included. The author can only build for OS/2, 
Windows, Linux and AIX. The other executable files (if any) are
contributions from other people who ported the benchmark to their 
platform. However, those executables may be out of date now (based 
on earlier versions). Especially, executables of version 1.16 and
newer will not communicate with versions below 1.16.

This program/these programs can be used freely for private or

please contact the author. You may redistribute this software only if
all files from my original distribution are included unchanged. You may
only add readable documentation files, such as a BBS signature, and only
if they are marked prominently as additions. If you want to include any
part of the orignal distribution with other software, please contact the

There is no warranty. Use this software on your own risk. Due to the
complexity and variety of today's hardware and software which may be
used to run these programs, I am not responsible for any damage or loss
of data or hardware failures or other damage caused by correct or
incorrect use of this software. It was tested very well and is expected
to work correctly, but nobody can actually guarantee this under any
circumstances. And because this software is essentially free (even if
you register, you don't pay for using this software but for the service
of getting upgrades), you get what you pay for ...
